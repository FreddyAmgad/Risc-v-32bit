# Risc-v-32bit

Welcome to the RISC-V 32-bit Processor Simulator in Verilog. This project offers a robust environment for simulating a RISC-V processor supporting the RV32I base instruction set. Built with Verilog, our simulator faithfully replicates the behavior of an actual processor, enabling users to explore RISC-V assembly language programs with confidence. With features like comprehensive testing, customizable configurations, and performance analysis tools, users can delve deep into program behavior and optimize for efficiency. Whether you're a researcher, student, or developer, our simulator provides a professional-grade platform for experimentation and analysis in the realm of RISC-V architecture.
